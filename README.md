Description: Our project was based on our own version of a music playing app. Using the youtube-api-search and express handlebars we created a website that allows the user to be able to search up songs. Once they have been searched they automatically get put in the playlist that is created for you. Once there you can press the play song button and the song will begin to play. There is also a delete button that removes the song when you desire.

Installation: You need to install sequelize, express and express-handlebars, mysql2 all through the terminal. Finally change the password to have access to my database.


Credit: The project was created by Kevin, Yong, Sergio and Jacob. The tasks were: Kevin created backend, Yong made the calls to GET, DELETE and POST.  Sergio created the front end and Jacob made style changes as well as powerpoint.
